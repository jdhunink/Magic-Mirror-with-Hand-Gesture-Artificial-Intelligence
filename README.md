# Magic-Mirror-with-Hand-Gesture-Artificial-Intelligence

Status: In Progress

A Raspberry Pi powered monitor set behind one way glass creating a reflective mirror with
a backlit display. The interface uses the Magic Mirror repo and a couple of extra packages built for the magic mirror itself.
The Mirror is also attached with a Webcam that utilizes artificial intelligence traind on Twenty Billion Neurons "Jester" Dataset.
A 24GB dataset filled with over 140,000 videos of people delivering hand gesture from a "swipe left" motion to turning 
their hand clockwise and counter clockwise. The hand gesture AI recieves input and swipes pages and zooms in adding a level of interactivity with the mirror
rather than just a stagnant screen.
